# access-estimator
This repository contains the code used to estimate electricity access levels as a gridded raster, using night-time lights satellite imagery, population data, urban levels and national and sub-national statistics. Along with [gridfinder](https://github.com/carderne/gridfinder), it contributes to the forthcoming paper *Predictive mapping of the global power system using open data* (currently in review), the overall methodology of which is described in the [predictive-mapping-global-power](https://github.com/carderne/predictive-mapping-global-power) repository.

## Usage and installation
Please see [predictive-mapping-global-power](https://github.com/carderne/predictive-mapping-global-power) for usage notes. This repository is not intended to be used as a stand-alone.
